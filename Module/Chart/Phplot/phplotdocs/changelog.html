This is the summary change log for the PHPlot Reference Manual.

      </p></dd><dt><span class="term">2010-11-18</span></dt><dd><p>
Restructuring.
Too much advanced material was ending up in the basic programming chapter
"Concepts". There is now a new chapter "Advanced", which includes the material
on Callbacks (demoted from chapter to section), plus two sections previously
in "Concepts": custom data color callback, and truecolor images.
Also moved the Functions by Category chapter after Examples, not before.
      </p><p>
Added new section "Tuning Parameters" in the Advanced chapter, to provide
more information about class variables that can be set to adjust plot
appearance.
      </p></dd><dt><span class="term">2010-11-16</span></dt><dd><p>
Documented 3 new plot types - OHLC financial plots, with examples.

      </p></dd><dt><span class="term">2010-09-30</span></dt><dd><p>
Changes for new color processing. Mostly internal functions and methods,
but also two new public methods were added for controlling title colors.

Document new behavior of stackedbar plots with negative values.
      </p></dd><dt><span class="term">2010-09-25</span></dt><dd><p>
Changes for new X and Y axis position defaults.
      </p></dd><dt><span class="term">2010-09-13</span></dt><dd><p>
Documentation was added and changes made for horizontal plot types and their
new data types.
(This was previously an experimental feature, documented in a text file
included in with the PHPlot release.)
Three new examples were added, showing horizontal plot types.
      </p><p>
A terminology change was necessary due to the introduction of horizontal plots
and dual use of Y data labels, which are now symmetrical with X data labels.
Previously, <span class="emphasis"><em>data labels</em></span> referred to labels from the
data array which were displayed along the X axis or top edge, and
<span class="emphasis"><em>Y data labels</em></span> referred to the Y bar value labels
displayed within the plot area.
The manual now distinguishes these by type, not axis. <span class="emphasis"><em>Axis data
labels</em></span> are labels from the data array which are displayed along the
independent variable axis, and <span class="emphasis"><em>data value labels</em></span> show the
value of a data point using the dependent variable. The general term
<span class="emphasis"><em>data labels</em></span> is used to refer to both types of labels. (For
example, SetXDataLabelAngle applies to data labels - both axis data labels
and data value labels.)
      </p></dd><dt><span class="term">2010-09-08</span></dt><dd><p>
Changes were made throughout the manual to support production of a PDF
version. The changes should have only a small impact on the HTML version.

      </p></dd><dt><span class="term">2010-08-27</span></dt><dd><p>

after PHPlot-5.1.2 this works differently and hopefully better.
      </p></dd><dt><span class="term">2010-08-19</span></dt><dd><p>
Removed the Extra Data Processing section in the Concepts chapter, and
removed the <code class="filename">phplot_data.php</code> file from the installation

Added new chapter to Developer's Guide on the callbacks feature, and added
documentation of the 3 public functions used with callbacks to the Function
Reference. The text is based on the <code class="filename">Callbacks</code> file
which was included with PHPlot-5.0.4 (and will removed in the next release).
Although this is now documented in the manual,
the callbacks feature is still considered experimental.

line styles.
